## Description: 

This is project recreates a hangman game that allows the user to guess the letters in a random word,
The user has 5 lives/attempts to guess the corresponding letters in the word. With each correct guess a letter is 
revealed in the word and with every incorrect guess one life is subtracted.

## Aim and Objectives

The aim of the project is to put into practice what I have learned in Object Orientated Programming into practice by
creating a command line game that a user can play.
I learned how to break down a project into small manageable components and testing each component before moving onto the next task.
Further reinforcing the importance of planning and iterative testing in software development.

## Features
- Random Word Selection: The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- User Input: The player can input guesses one letter at a time.
- User lives: The player has 5 lives i.e 5 incorrect attempts after which they loss the game.
- Progress Display: The game displays the current state of the word, including correctly guessed letters and placeholders for remaining letters.
- Victory/Defeat Messages: The game ends with a message indicating whether the player has won or lost.
